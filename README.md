## Hi, I'm Suraj ðŸ‘‹
In 2017, I quit my sales job to explore web development. Over the years, I delved into several subjects including React, R3F, WebFlow, Wordpress, branding strategy, designing, 3d modeling, public speaking (Toastmasters) and business. I've honed my skills through part-time work, online courses, and personal projects. My strengths include discipline, breaking down problems into manageable tasks, and clear communication. 

My vision is to develop websites and applications from strategy through design to development. I want to build tools that help people manage their lives and support their personal development. Although I have aspirations to explore React Native and WebGL, currently I'm focused on becoming a proficient full-stack web developer, so I'm excited about switching to web development fulltime.
