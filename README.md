## Hi, I'm Suraj ðŸ‘‹
I want to build tools that help people manage their lives and support their personal development. I work in React/Next and I'm currently learning full-stack development. Although I have aspirations to explore React Native and WebGL, currently I'm focused on becoming a proficient full-stack web developer. I quit my sales job in 2017 and experimented with several subjects namely, Wordpress, Webflow, Illustrator, Blender and public speaking. I did several freelance design and development work during this time and now I'm excited about making the switch to a full-time web development career.
